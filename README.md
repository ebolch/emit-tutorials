Welcome to the EMIT tutorial repository.  This repository stands outside of the main emit-sds functionality.  It serves to provide examples for how to use data and code from the EMIT mission, and is part of a collaboration between the LP DAAC, the EMIT team, and the broader community.  Contributions from all parties are welcome.
